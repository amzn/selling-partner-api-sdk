# software.amzn.spapi.Model.merchantFulfillment.v0.PredefinedPackageDimensions
An enumeration of predefined parcel tokens. If you specify a `PredefinedPackageDimensions` token, you are not obligated to use a branded package from a carrier. For example, if you specify the `FedEx_Box_10kg` token, you do not have to use that particular package from FedEx. You are only obligated to use a box that matches the dimensions specified by the token. Note: Carriers can have restrictions on the type of package allowed for certain ship methods. Check the carrier website for details. Example: Flat rate pricing is available when materials are sent by USPS in a USPS-produced Flat Rate envelope or box.

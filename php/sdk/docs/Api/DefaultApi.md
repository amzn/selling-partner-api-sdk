```php
listTransactions($posted_after, $posted_before, $marketplace_id, $next_token): \OpenAPI\Client\Model\finances\v2024_06_19\ListTransactionsResponse
```



Returns transactions for the given parameters. Orders from the last 48 hours might not be included in financial events.  **Usage Plan:**  | Rate (requests per second) | Burst | | ---- | ---- | | 0.5 | 10 |  The `x-amzn-RateLimit-Limit` response header returns the usage plan rate limits that were applied to the requested operation, when available. The preceding table contains the default rate and burst values for this operation. Selling partners whose business demands require higher throughput may have higher rate and burst values than those shown here.

$next_token = jehgri34yo7jr9e8f984tr9i4o; // string | The response includes `nextToken` when the number of results exceeds the specified `pageSize` value. To get the next page of results, call the operation with this token and include the same arguments as the call that produced the token. To get a complete list, call this operation until `nextToken` is null. Note that this operation can return empty pages.

try {
    $result = $apiInstance->listTransactions($posted_after, $posted_before, $marketplace_id, $next_token);
    print_r($result);
} catch (Exception $e) {

### Getting started

#### Credentials

Before you can use the SDK, you need to be registered as a Selling Partner API developer. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in the [SP-API Registration Overview](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/sp-api-registration-overview).
You also need to register your application to get valid credentials to call SP-API. If you haven't done that yet, please follow the instructions in [Registering your Application](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/registering-your-application).
If you are already registered successfully, you can find instructions on how to view your credentials in [Viewing your Application Information and Credentials](https://developer-docs.amazon.com/sp-api/docs/viewing-your-application-information-and-credentials).

#### Minimum requirements

To run the SDK you need Java 11 or higher.

#### Integrate the SDK

1. Find the latest version number [here](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-sdk/releases).
2. Add the dependency to your project (see instructions for [Gradle](#gradle) and [Maven](#maven) below).

##### Gradle

Add the following line to the dependencies in your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation 'software.amazon.spapi:spapi-sdk:0.1.0'
```

##### Maven

Add the following lines to the dependencies in your `maven.pom` file:

```xml
<dependencies>
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>software.amazon.spapi</groupId>
        <artifactId>spapi-sdk</artifactId>
        <version>0.1.0</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
</dependencies>
```

### Use the SDK

In order to call one of the APIs included in the Selling Partner API, you need to:
1. Configure credentials (Note: Use your individual credentials for `clientId`, `clientSecret` and `refreshToken`)
2. Create an instance for a specific API
3. Call an operation

For an example, refer to the following sample code for connecting to Sellers API:
```java
// Configure your LWA credentials
LWAAuthorizationCredentials lwaAuthorizationCredentials = LWAAuthorizationCredentials.builder()
    .clientId("amzn1.application-*********************")
    .clientSecret("***********************************")
    .refreshToken("Atzr|******************************")
    .endpoint("https://api.amazon.com/auth/o2/token")
    .build();

// Create an instance of the Sellers API
SellersApi sellersApi = new SellersApi.Builder()
    .lwaAuthorizationCredentials(lwaAuthorizationCredentials)
    .endpoint("https://sellingpartnerapi-na.amazon.com") // use Sandbox URL here if you would like to test your applications without affecting production data.
    .build();

// Call operation
GetMarketplaceParticipationsResponse result = sellersApi.getMarketplaceParticipations();
```
